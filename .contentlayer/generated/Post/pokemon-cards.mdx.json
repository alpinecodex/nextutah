    "raw": "\nI can still remember the musty basement classroom that housed 30 plus middle school boys for health class. Despite the respectful language that southern parents pushed on their kids, cuss words were constantly thrown around in awkward casualness. It seemed as if this time at school was the only time these boys could really speak freely. Teachers typically rued the post lunch period since students would come back with dauntless energy and a complete lack of interest in learning. It was only made worse by the fact that our 7th grade class was newly starting the 'health' portion of the year following a semester of normal physical education. But Mr. H didn't seem to care. In fact, he never really seemed to care about anything. A few months earlier, a fight broke out while playing kickball that resulted in multiple suspensions, several hospital visits, and at least one surgery to repair broken bones. Despite the damages, I distinctly remember Mr. H's refusal to break up the fight saying, \"nah boys, let 'em work it out.\"\n\nMr. H's health middle school health class was ironically comical and strangely stereotypical. It was painful to receive orders to \"run faster\" from a man that was 300+ lbs. And it was even more painful to take sex education from a man that would later be arrested on prostitution charges during an undercover sting operation in the area. Stereotypically, Mr H. clearly picked favorites among the boys based on athletic abilities and interests. If you were good at football or basketball, he was your best friend. In a southern town, you can probably guess what type of kids the favorites ended up being —— country club kids born with golden spoons in their mouths. The story went that if you weren't one of these jocks, you were luckly if Mr. H knew who you were during the entirety of the year.\n\nOne day at the end of class there were about 15 minutes of free time. Despite being an outgoing kid, for whatever reason, I wasn't chatting with any of my friends in class. That day in particular, I was sitting behind two popular kids, listening to them berate a boy named Ray. Ray was mildly tempered and never said a harmful word to anyone. He was hardly 5 feet tall and weighed 90 pounds soaking wet. Unbeknownst to me at the time, Ray carried himself with a reverent dignity. He treated others with kindness and carried no amount of pride. Unlike every other middle schooler, he didn't care what you wore, what you liked, or what you looked like——he was going to be nice to you regardless. With the free time he had at the end of class, Ray had pulled out a few Pokémon cards and was excitedly showing them off to his good friend beside him. Relentlessly, the two boys next to him saw the Pokémon cards and began to spat out insults one after another. With every word spoken, the words cut deeper and deeper into Ray. I could see as Ray began to withdraw, retreating inwardly as he faced a barrage of increasingly painful words.\n\nI felt blood rush to my head and my face turn bright red. My collar heated up but I remained still and almost lifeless. I kept thinking to myself, \"What's wrong with Pokémon?\" Each day when I went home, I spent countless hours playing various Pokémon games on my Nintendo DS.\n",
